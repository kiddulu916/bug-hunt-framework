## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Caching Strategy
```python
# Example usage of the new caching system
@cache_result(ttl=300, key_prefix="vuln_stats")
def get_vulnerability_statistics():
    # Expensive database query
    return expensive_computation()

# Cache invalidation on model changes
@invalidate_cache_on_change(['vuln:*', 'stats:*'])
def create_vulnerability():
    # Create vulnerability and auto-invalidate related caches
```

### Performance Monitoring
```python
# Real-time performance tracking
@monitor_query_performance
def complex_database_operation():
    # Automatically tracked for performance metrics
    return database_query()
```

### Security Validation
```python
# Enhanced request validation
def secure_endpoint(request: Request):
    # Automatic threat detection and blocking
    security_manager.validate_request_security(request)
    # Enhanced input validation
    sanitized_data = security_manager.enhanced_input_validation(request_data)
```

## 📋 Verification Checklist

To verify the optimizations are working:

1. **Check Cache Performance**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/performance
   # Look for cache hit rates > 70%
   ```

2. **Verify Security**:
   ```bash
   # Test SQL injection detection
   curl "http://localhost:8000/api/vulnerabilities/?search=' OR 1=1--"
   # Should be blocked with security violation
   ```

3. **Test Rate Limiting**:
   ```bash
   # Send rapid requests to test rate limiting
   for i in {1..110}; do curl http://localhost:8000/health; done
   # Should get 429 Too Many Requests after 100 requests
   ```

4. **Monitor Database Performance**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health/detailed
   # Check database performance metrics
   ```

## 🎯 Success Metrics

The optimizations are successful if you observe:
- ✅ API response times under 150ms for cached content
- ✅ Database queries under 100ms for optimized queries
- ✅ Cache hit rates above 75%
- ✅ Zero security incidents from blocked threats
