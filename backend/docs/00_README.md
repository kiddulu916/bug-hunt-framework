## Technology Stack

- **Frameworks**: Django 5.x (ORM, Admin) + FastAPI 0.110+ (API)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ (primary), Redis 7+ (cache, queue)
- **Task Queue**: Celery 5.x with Redis broker
- **Authentication**: JWT with role-based access control
- **API Docs**: Automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- **Testing**: Pytest with 80%+ coverage requirements

## Project Overview

The Bug Hunt Framework is a comprehensive automated penetration testing platform designed for bug bounty hunters and security teams. It combines:

- **Automated Reconnaissance**: Multi-phase OSINT and asset discovery
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Nuclei templates + custom engines
- **Exploitation Verification**: Safe PoC generation and verification
- **Professional Reporting**: Multi-format reports (PDF, HTML, JSON, CSV)
- **Real-time Monitoring**: WebSocket updates and notifications

## Key Features

### Hybrid Django/FastAPI Architecture
- Django for robust ORM, migrations, and admin interface
- FastAPI for high-performance async API endpoints
- Seamless integration between both frameworks

### Comprehensive Scanning Pipeline
1. **Passive Reconnaissance** - Subdomain enumeration, OSINT
2. **Active Reconnaissance** - Port scanning, service detection
3. **Vulnerability Testing** - Automated security testing
4. **Exploitation** - Vulnerability verification
5. **Reporting** - Professional documentation

### Enterprise Security
- Multi-layered authentication and authorization
- Threat detection and prevention
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Encrypted sensitive data storage

### Scalable Architecture
- Celery background workers for concurrent scans
- Redis caching for performance
- Connection pooling and query optimization
- Horizontal scaling support
